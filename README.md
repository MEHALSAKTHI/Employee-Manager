# EmplyMgr V2


Managing details of employees is a very important and hectic task for all companies, institutions and organisations. This is generally done on paper and this has several serious disadvantages. Preservation of these documents must be ensured and have to be stored in a safe place. 

These data once lost is lost..!

EmplyMgr serves this issue very well. 

Details of Employees like biodata, attendance and salary can be organised in a clear and safe way. 

Storing, Updating, Deleting and Viewing all these data is well managed by light weight software frameworks. 

Advanced Framewroks used here serve the purpose of efficient & quick functioning.

-- This application is currently staged with its version v2 and added with few more features on the attendance module --

There is still a greater scope for this project and the expansional development is still in progress..
